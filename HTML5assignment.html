    <h1>HTML5</h1>
    <h4>1. What are the new tags added in HTML5?</h4>
    <P>The audio tag and the video tag are the two major additions to the HTML5. The audio tag and the video tag enables
        developers to embed music and audio on their website. The audio & video tags also have a number of attributes
        for additional controls.
    </P>
    <h4>2. How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</h4>
    <p>Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called index. html . Add < audio> and < video> elements to the
                page; make them display the default browser controls. Give both of them < source> elements so that
                    browsers will find the audio format they support best and load it.</p>
    <h4>3. Semantic element in HTML5?</h4>
    <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of semantic
        elements: < form> , < table> , and < article> - Clearly defines its content.</p>
    <h4>4. Canvas and SVG tags</h4>
    <p>The primary distinction between the two is that SVG uses geometric shapes to render graphics, whereas Canvas uses
        pixels. This means that SVG graphics are resolution-independent, which means they can be resized without losing
        quality, whereas Canvas graphics become blurry and distorted when resized</p>
